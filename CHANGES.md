## Update 4: Graphics Implementation Roadmap

### Graphics System Implementation Plan

This roadmap outlines the implementation of a basic SDL2 graphics system for Realms of Eldoria, following VCMI architectural patterns. The implementation will start with minimal assets at 1080p-ready resolution.

#### Phase 1: Graphics Foundation (Week 1-2)

#### Asset Requirements Summary

**Minimum Asset Set for MVP (1080p-ready quality):**

Terrain Tiles (128x128px each):
- Dirt, Sand, Grass, Snow, Swamp, Rough, Lava, Water (8 total)

Map Objects (high-res placeholders):
- Hero (64x64 or 96x96px)
- Town (128x128px or 192x192px)
- Mine (96x96px or 128x128px)
- Monster (64x64 or 96x96px)
- Resource pile (48x48 or 64x64px)
- Tree/decoration (64x64 or 96x96px)

UI Assets:
- Panel backgrounds (stretchable 9-patch or solid fills)
- Resource icons (64x64px each, 7 types)
- Button states (normal, hover, pressed)
- Font (TTF, clean and readable)

Battle Assets (if Phase 5 included):
- Battlefield background (1920x1080px)
- Creature battle sprites (96x96px or 128x128px)
- UI elements (buttons, panels)

**Asset Strategy:**
- Start with simple geometric/solid color placeholders
- Gradually replace with pixel art or free assets from OpenGameArt/Kenney.nl
- Keep consistent art style (recommend 2D pixel art or low-poly 3D renders)
- All assets should be 2x or 3x native size for crisp 1080p display

#### Technical Notes

**Dependencies to Add:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

**Key VCMI Code to Reuse:**
- **Rendering Core**: Canvas, IImage, Graphics, SDL_Extensions → copy directly
- **GUI Framework**: CIntObject, EventDispatcher, WindowHandler, widgets → copy and simplify
- **Adventure Map**: AdventureMapInterface, MapView, MapRenderer → copy and adapt to our GameMap
- **Battle Interface**: BattleInterface, BattleRenderer → copy and adapt to our BattleEngine
- **Asset Loading**: Image loaders, resource caching → copy but simplify (no .lod/.def formats)

**VCMI License Note:**
- VCMI is GPL v2 licensed - ensure compliance by keeping license headers
- This project should also be GPL v2 compatible when using VCMI code
- Credit VCMI team in copied files with original copyright notices

**Performance Targets:**
- 60 FPS at 1080p resolution
- <100ms asset loading times
- Smooth scrolling and transitions
- Efficient dirty rectangle rendering

#### Success Criteria

**Minimum Viable Graphics (End of Phase 4):**
- ✅ Windowed 1080p game running at 60 FPS
- ✅ Scrollable adventure map with terrain and objects visible
- ✅ Hero movement via mouse clicks
- ✅ Resource bar displaying current resources
- ✅ Hero panel showing selected hero stats
- ✅ Turn advancement via UI
- ✅ All ASCII client features accessible in graphics client

**Full Graphics Implementation (End of Phase 5):**
- ✅ Battle screen with graphical unit display
- ✅ Smooth animations for movement and combat
- ✅ Complete UI coverage (all ASCII features have graphics equivalent)
- ✅ Polished visual presentation ready for gameplay

This roadmap provides a clear path from the current working ASCII game to a fully graphical 1080p experience while maintaining the solid game logic foundation already implemented.

## Update 5: Graphics Foundation - Phase 1 Complete

# Clean and rebuild
make clean && make graphics-test
```

#### Next Steps for Phase 2

With the rendering foundation in place, Phase 2 will focus on:

2. Add texture/sprite support
3. Implement basic tile rendering
4. Create map view with camera system
5. Begin adventure map rendering

The Canvas system is now ready to support image blitting, which will enable terrain tiles and sprite rendering in Phase 2.

## Update 6: Phase 2 Complete - Map Rendering with Tiles

### Phase 2 Implementation Summary (Completed)

Successfully implemented map rendering with terrain tiles, camera system, and placeholder graphics. The game map is now fully rendered with scrolling support.

  - Camera/viewport system with scrolling
  - Object layer rendering (mines, monsters)
  - Hero layer rendering
  - Screen ↔ tile coordinate conversion
  - Visible tile culling for performance

**Placeholder Assets** (`assets/tiles/`):

  - Configurable colors per terrain type
  - BMP format for SDL compatibility

#### Technical Implementation

**Image System:**
- Simplified from VCMI's complex IImage/ISharedImage architecture
- Direct SDL_Surface wrapping for simplicity
- Supports BMP loading (PNG support ready via SDL2_image)
- Efficient move semantics to avoid copies
- Canvas integration for blitting

**Map View Architecture:**
- Layered rendering: terrain → objects → heroes
- Camera position in tile coordinates
- Viewport size in pixels
- Visible tile calculation with culling
- Tile-to-screen coordinate transformation
- Placeholder colored rectangles for objects/heroes

**Terrain Tile Management:**
- Map terrain types to image files
- Lazy loading on MapView construction
- std::map<TerrainType, unique_ptr<Image>> storage
- Fallback to colored tiles if BMP missing

**Performance Features:**
- Only renders visible tiles (viewport culling)
- Tile-based coordinate system
- Efficient blitting via SDL_BlitSurface
- No unnecessary redraws (event-driven)

#### Build Commands

```bash
# Build map renderer test
make map-test

# Run it (opens 1920x1080 window with scrollable map)
make run-map-test

# Controls:
#   Arrow keys: Scroll map
#   Home: Center on middle
#   ESC/Q: Exit

# Rebuild from scratch
make clean && make map-test
```

#### Visual Output

The map test demonstrates:
- **Terrain variety**: 8 different colored terrain types with patterns
- **Objects**: Yellow mines, red monster groups rendered as colored squares (16×16px)
- **Heroes**: Cyan squares with white borders (12×12px) at positions (5,7) and (12,8)
- **Smooth scrolling**: Arrow keys move camera one tile at a time
- **Large viewport**: 60×32 tiles visible on 1920×1080 screen (32×32px tiles)

#### Next Steps for Phase 3

With map rendering working, Phase 3 will focus on UI:
1. Copy VCMI's GUI widget system (CIntObject, EventDispatcher)
2. Create resource bar (top panel showing 7 resources + day)
3. Create hero panel (sidebar with hero info, stats, army)
4. Add click handling for hero selection
5. Implement mouse interaction with map
6. Add info windows and tooltips

The rendering foundation is now complete and ready for interactive UI elements!
