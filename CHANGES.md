Successfully implemented a complete graphical battle interface for the graphics client, replacing console output with a professional UI.

**Battle UI Components:**
- **BattleWindow**: Main battle interface container (1920×1080 fullscreen overlay)
- **BattleField**: Central battlefield display (1300×800px) showing unit positions
  - Player units on left (blue), enemy units on right (red)
  - Visual unit count display for each stack
  - Battlefield dividing line
- **BattleLog**: Combat message panel (300×200px, bottom-left)
  - Scrolling message history (10 messages max)
  - Battle start, damage, victory/defeat messages
- **UnitInfoPanel**: Unit details panel (700×200px, bottom-center)
  - Shows creature name, count, health
  - Distinguishes player vs enemy forces
- **Control Buttons**: Battle controls (280×50px each, bottom-right)
  - Auto Battle button: Executes full auto-battle
  - Close button: Dismisses battle window after completion

**Battle Flow Integration:**
1. Hero encounters monster on map → Battle UI appears
2. BattleEngine initialized with hero's army vs monsters
3. Auto-Battle button triggers combat execution
4. Real-time unit display updates during battle
5. Battle log shows round-by-round results
6. Victory/defeat message with experience gain
7. Close button enabled → returns to adventure map
8. Hero army updated with battle casualties

**Technical Implementation:**
- `client/ui/BattleWindow.h/.cpp` - Complete battle UI system
- Widget-based architecture matching existing UI framework
- Label rendering for text display (no raw font calls)
- Callback system for battle completion handling
- Proper z-ordering: battle window overlays map when active
- Memory management: BattleEngine cleaned up after battle

**UI Features:**
- Dark semi-transparent panels (consistent with game theme)
- Color-coded units (blue for player, red for enemy)
- Real-time battlefield visualization
- Smooth UI state transitions
- Keyboard/mouse input handling during battle

Graphics client now provides complete battle visualization matching the ASCII client's combat system.

### Graphics Client Combat System Integration (Previous Update)
Added full battle system integration to graphics client:

**Combat Features:**
- Monster encounter detection when hero moves onto monster tile
- Auto-battle execution using existing BattleEngine
- Victory handling:
  - Monsters removed from map
  - Hero gains experience
  - Hero moves to conquered position
  - Army casualties reflected in hero panel
- Defeat handling:
  - Hero loses all movement points
  - Hero retreats (doesn't move to monster position)
  - Army casualties reflected in hero panel
- Console output for battle events (temporary until battle UI is added)

**Battle Flow:**
1. Hero clicks adjacent tile with monster
2. BattleEngine executes auto-battle
3. Surviving units updated in hero's army
4. Experience awarded on victory
5. UI refreshes to show updated hero stats and army

Graphics client now has complete combat functionality matching the ASCII client battle system.

### Graphics Client Game State Initialization
Added complete game state initialization to graphics client (`client/graphics_client.cpp`):

**Game Setup:**
- Creates player with starting resources (10 Wood, 5 Mercury, 10 Ore, 5 Sulfur, 5 Crystal, 5 Gems, 20000 Gold)
- Creates two heroes with different classes:
  - Sir Aldric (Knight) at position (5, 7) with Leadership 2, Attack 1
  - Lady Morgana (Wizard) at position (12, 8) with Wisdom 2, Mysticism 1
- Both heroes start with armies (Peasants + Archers)
- Full movement points on game start

**Map Creation:**
- 40×25 tile map named "Tutorial Valley"
- 3 resource mines (Gold, Wood, Ore) at strategic locations
- 13 monster groups with varying difficulty:
  - Weak encounters (2-3 units)
  - Medium encounters (4-6 units)
  - Strong encounters (6-8 units)
  - Mine guards protecting resources
  - Roaming groups for exploration

Graphics client now starts with a complete, playable game state matching the ASCII client experience.

### Graphics Client API Fixes
Fixed `client/graphics_client.cpp` to use correct APIs from GameState, Hero, MapView, and Canvas classes:

**Type Mismatches Fixed:**
- Hero uses `Position` (x, y, z) not `Point` (x, y) - added conversions when calling MapView methods
- Canvas uses `ColorRGBA` not `Color` - updated fill() calls

**GameState API Corrections:**
- Changed `getPlayers()` to `getAllPlayers()` which returns `std::map<PlayerID, std::unique_ptr<Player>>`
- Changed `getPlayers()[id]` to `getPlayer(id)` which returns `Player*`
- Iterate through getAllPlayers() using structured binding: `for (const auto& [playerId, player] : getAllPlayers())`
- Player's `getHeroes()` returns `std::vector<HeroID>` not hero objects - use `gameState->getHero(heroId)` to get Hero*

**Hero API Corrections:**
- Changed `getCurrentMovement()` to `getMovementPoints()`
- Removed non-existent `move()` method - use `setPosition()` and `setMovementPoints()` instead
- Added manual movement point deduction when moving hero

**MapView API Corrections:**
- Constructor takes `Point viewportSize` not map and state pointers
- `render()` method requires `Canvas&, GameMap&, GameState&` parameters - not called on canvas
- Removed non-existent `setViewport()` and `setCamera()` methods

**Canvas API Corrections:**
- Changed from `std::unique_ptr<Canvas>` to creating Canvas per-frame with `Canvas::createFromSurface()`
- `createFromSurface()` returns Canvas by value, not pointer
- Moved canvas creation into render() method since Canvas has deleted copy constructor

**GameState Initialization:**
- Removed non-existent `initialize()` method call
- Added TODO comment for proper map loading and game state setup

All changes ensure the graphics client compiles with the actual API signatures from the game engine classes.

- All assets should be 2x or 3x native size for crisp 1080p display

#### Technical Notes

**Dependencies to Add:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

**Key VCMI Code to Reuse:**
- **Rendering Core**: Canvas, IImage, Graphics, SDL_Extensions → copy directly
- **GUI Framework**: CIntObject, EventDispatcher, WindowHandler, widgets → copy and simplify
- **Adventure Map**: AdventureMapInterface, MapView, MapRenderer → copy and adapt to our GameMap
- **Battle Interface**: BattleInterface, BattleRenderer → copy and adapt to our BattleEngine
- **Asset Loading**: Image loaders, resource caching → copy but simplify (no .lod/.def formats)

**VCMI License Note:**
- VCMI is GPL v2 licensed - ensure compliance by keeping license headers
- This project should also be GPL v2 compatible when using VCMI code
- Credit VCMI team in copied files with original copyright notices

**Performance Targets:**
- 60 FPS at 1080p resolution

- ✅ `generate_placeholder_tiles.py` - Python script to generate terrain BMPs
  - Creates solid-color tiles with subtle variation
  - Configurable colors per terrain type
  - BMP format for SDL compatibility

#### Technical Implementation

**Image System:**
- Simplified from VCMI's complex IImage/ISharedImage architecture
- Direct SDL_Surface wrapping for simplicity
- Supports BMP loading (PNG support ready via SDL2_image)
- Efficient move semantics to avoid copies
- Canvas integration for blitting

**Map View Architecture:**
- Layered rendering: terrain → objects → heroes
- Camera position in tile coordinates
- Viewport size in pixels
- Visible tile calculation with culling
- Tile-to-screen coordinate transformation
- Placeholder colored rectangles for objects/heroes

**Terrain Tile Management:**
- Map terrain types to image files
- Lazy loading on MapView construction
- std::map<TerrainType, unique_ptr<Image>> storage
- Fallback to colored tiles if BMP missing

**Performance Features:**
- Only renders visible tiles (viewport culling)
- Tile-based coordinate system
- Efficient blitting via SDL_BlitSurface
- No unnecessary redraws (event-driven)

#### Build Commands

```bash
# Build map renderer test
make map-test

# Run it (opens 1920x1080 window with scrollable map)
make run-map-test

# Controls:
#   Arrow keys: Scroll map
#   Home: Center on middle
#   ESC/Q: Exit

# Rebuild from scratch
make clean && make map-test
```

#### Visual Output

The map test demonstrates:
- **Terrain variety**: 8 different colored terrain types with patterns
- **Objects**: Yellow mines, red monster groups rendered as colored squares (16×16px)
- **Heroes**: Cyan squares with white borders (12×12px) at positions (5,7) and (12,8)
- **Smooth scrolling**: Arrow keys move camera one tile at a time
- **Large viewport**: 60×32 tiles visible on 1920×1080 screen (32×32px tiles)

### Phase 2 Enhancement: Zoom System Added

#### Map Zoom Implementation (Completed)
- ✅ **128x128 Base Tiles** - All terrain tiles generated at high resolution
- ✅ **Dynamic Zoom Levels** - Three zoom levels: 32px, 64px, 128px
- ✅ **SDL_BlitScaled** - Efficient tile scaling from base 128x128 to current zoom
- ✅ **Zoom Controls**:
  - `+/=` keys or mouse wheel up: Zoom in (64→128px, shows 15×8 tiles)
  - `-` key or mouse wheel down: Zoom out (64→32px, shows 60×33 tiles)
  - Default: 64px tiles showing 30×17 tiles on 1920×1080 screen
- ✅ **Adaptive UI** - Objects and heroes scale proportionally with zoom level
- ✅ **Viewport Recalculation** - Visible tile count adjusts dynamically per zoom

#### Technical Details
- **Base tile size**: 128×128px (stored in assets)
- **Min zoom**: 32px (strategic overview, see entire 40×25 map)
- **Default zoom**: 64px (balanced view)
- **Max zoom**: 128px (detailed view, 1:1 pixel ratio)
- **Scaling method**: SDL_BlitScaled for hardware-accelerated scaling
- **Path fix**: Tiles load from `../../assets/tiles/` to work with `make run-map-test`

#### Build Commands
```bash
make map-test         # Build map renderer with zoom
make run-map-test     # Run from build/bin/ directory (correct asset paths)
./build/bin/MapTest   # Also works from project root
```

The zoom system provides smooth scaling from strategic overview to detailed close-up view while maintaining performance at 60 FPS.
